          I’m a junior full-stack developer with a background in fashion design,
          where I spent seven years bringing creative concepts to life in
          fast-paced, structured projects. My work combined creativity with
          precision, guiding products from idea to production. I’m excited to
          grow into a full-stack developer role where I can blend creative
          thinking with technical problem-solving to build intuitive,
          well-structured software solutions.
